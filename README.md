## About Me

I’m a recent graduate from Thunderbird School of Global Management with a background in **global business, ESG finance, and operations strategy**. Now, I’m diving into the world of **software development** to better build and support the kinds of automation systems I believe can empower small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) to thrive.

Currently focused on:

- **Workflow Automation** with n8n and low-code tools  
- **Learning to build** with Python, SQL, Power BI, and scripting  
- **Designing systems** that help entrepreneurs delegate backend operations to digital agents

My long-term goal is to develop products that **bridge business strategy and software automation** — systems that scale.
